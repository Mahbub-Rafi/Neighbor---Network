# Neighbor - Network

In times of trouble, our neighbors are usually the first ones to help us. These people are usually doctors, nurses, techs, or police officers. However, transportation issues make it hard for many people to get help. Within a 20-minute walking radius, an online app has been made to help people get emergency help. People can ask their neighbors for help with this app, which also motivates them to change the way they live. Full-stack web application development and current languages and scripts are used to make an easy-to-use online app that will connect customers with service providers in a wide range of industries. This will make the service available to as many people as possible.

## Project Specifications: 
### Users and Their Roles: 
### User: 
The user will sign up for the system by entering pertinent information such as their name, email, phone number, location, and date of birth. When they join up, they will be assigned a unique user id (UID). Signing can also be done with a Google account. They will then be required to authenticate their identity before delivering or obtaining services. To prove their identity, each user must go through a verification procedure that includes submitting their NID, worker permit/license, testimonial, and referral system. Verified users will be assigned two roles: one as a customer and one as a service provider. They will be able to seek assistance or services as a customer. In the same way, a service provider will be allowed to accept the request. 

### Admin: 
Admin will have full access to administer the system, including the ability to change a user's information, verify documents, suspend an account, and contact local police authorities based on an alert system.
